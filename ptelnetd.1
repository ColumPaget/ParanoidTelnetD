.SH DESCRIPTION
ptelnetd is a telnet server for the paranoid. It\'s intended to be used in those situations where you can\'t avoid using telnet, e.g. as a server to some embedded hardware that doesn\'t support encrypted communications. It\'s major feature is that it has it\'s own authentication system, so that users and passwords can be created that ONLY apply to ptelnetd.

.SH AUTHENTICATION
.TP
ptelnetd can use a number of different authentication methods, which can be set with the \'-auth-types\' command line option. Available types are:
  native     The default method. Uses ptelnetd\'s native authentication file (specified with -auth-file, defaults to /etc/ptelnetd.auth) to authenticate.
  pam        Use Pluggable Authentication Modules.
  shadow     Authenticate against passwords in /etc/shadow.
  passwd     Authenticate against passwords in /etc/passwd.
  cr-md5     Challenge/Response using native file passwords and md5 hashing.
  cr-sha1    Challenge/Response using native file passwords and sha1 hashing.
  cr-sha256  Challenge/Response using native file passwords and sha256 hashing.
  cr-sha512  Challenge/Response using native file passwords and sha512 hashing.
  pam-account Authenticate by any means, but check if PAM thinks the account is allowed/valid.
  open       NO AUTHENTICATION. This method has certain restrictions.
.PP
\'open\' authentication can only be used in combination with either -chroot or -chhome. Without some form of chroot jail, \'open\' authentication would allow anyone to get a shell on your system without logging in, which would be a Bad Thing.
.PP
\'native\' authentication is set up using the \'ptelnetd -user add/delete/list\' commands. The default authentication file is /etc/ptelnetd, but this can be overridden with the \'-auth-file\' option.
.PP
\'pam-account\' doesn\'t authenticate, instead authentication is performed by other means, and pam-account then checks if PAM thinks the account is allowed to log in, even if it authenticated. This might be used if a .nologin flag was set, or if a user is only allowed to log in from certain hosts, or at certain times of day.
.PP
\'cr-md5\', \'cr-sha1\', \'cr-sha256\', \'cr-sha512\'. These are challenge-response authentication types. They require a password stored in PLAINTEXT in the native authentication file. When any of these authentication types are active the ptelnetd server sends a \'Challenge\' string on the line before the \'login\' prompt. The user authenticates by concatanating their password to the Challenge string (seperated by a colon) and then hashing the entire resulting string with the specified hash function. They submit this hashed string at the hash prompt. These hash strings can be created using utilites like \'md5sum\' or \'sha512sum\' by doing: \'echo -n 4+SiluCNxtX/CfM1jGnnK2JiunOnwnlz:MyPassword | md5sum\' Where the long string before the colon is the Challenge obtained from the server, and \'MyPassword\' is the users password.
.PP
Most authentication methods can be used in combination by listing them as comma-separated values. The only exception is \'open\', which must be specified on its own, or it will be ignored


.SH USERS and REAL USERS
.PP
When using \'native\' authentication, ptelentd uses it\'s own \'users scheme\'. \'native\' users are \'virtual\' users that map to a \'real\' user. For instance, there could be \'native\' users called \'Tom\', \'Dick\' and \'Harriet\', and they could all run as the real user \'nobody\'. Ptelnetd searches for a suitable \'real user\' at startup, checking for the existence of the \'nobody\', \'guest\' or \'daemon\' accounts, and using the first one it finds. This behavior can be overridden with the \'-real-user\' option, which explicitly specifies the user to be used.
.PP
When not using \'native\' or \'open\' authentication, the users are the real users specified in /etc/passwd. However, the \'-real-user\' command can still be used to switch them to some other user after they\'ve authenticated.

.SH VARIABLES.
.PP
Some config options (for example \'banner\') accept string arguments that may take variables. e.g.
.PP
  ptelnetd -banner \'Welcome to $(ServerHost) running on port $(ServerPort) of $(ServerIP)\'
.PP
(Note use of single quotes to protect \'$\' from the shell).
.TP
Available variables are:
  ClientHost           Hostname of the client
  ClientIP             IP-Address of the client
  ClientMAC            MAC-Address of the client
  ServerHost           Hostname of the server
  ServerIP             IP-Address of the server
  ServerPort           Port that ptelnetd is running on
  Interface            Interface that ptelnetd is bound to
  User                 User (available after authentication)
  RealUser             Real User (i.e. unix system user). (Available after authentication)
  Time                 Time in %H:%M:%S format
  Date                 Date in %Y/%m/%d format
  DateTime             Date and time in %Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S format
.PP
Variables can be used in the banner, in \'Dynamic home directory\' paths, and in the pidfile path. \'ClientIP\', \'ClientHost\' and \'ClientMAC\' are only available after a connection is made. \'User\' and \'RealUser\' are only available after login.

.SH CHROOT AND CHHOME
.PP
Paranoid TelnetD supports two types of chroot jail. \'ChHome\' happens after login, and chroots the user\'s shell into their home directory. This means that the user sees themselves locked into their home directory, which is now their root directory. However, the user\'s connection is serviced by a helper process that exists outside of the chhome jail, so that when the user logs off the \'Logout script\' can be run to take any files out of the chhome jail and import them into applications on the main system (see LOGIN/LOGOUT SCRIPTS below). In this mode authentication, login/logout scripting, bind mounts and dynamic home directories are all processed OUTSIDE of and BEFORE chhome.
.PP
The other type of chroot is configured with the \'-chroot <path>\' command-line argument. This chroots the helper process and the shell into the specified directory. This means that everything that happens is locked into the chroot directory. This is intended for systems where there\'s an entire OS installation (a traditional chroot environment) that everything should be locked into. This has impacts on authentication, as all the authentication files must now be in the chroot directory; \'dynhome\', because the dynamic home directory will be created relative to the chroot, \'Bind mounts\', as the mounted directories will be relative to chroot, and \'login/logout scripts\', as these scripts too must be installed in the chroot.

.SH DYNHOME: DYNAMIC HOME DIRECTORIES
.PP
Paranoid TelnetD supports on-the-fly home directory creation. By supplying variables in the path supplied as an argument to -dynhome one can specify a unique directory for a user or host or IP or mac, or any combination of these. This directory is created and used as the home directory after login. When the session ends, the directory should be deleted (this can fail if there are files left in the directory)

.SH BIND MOUNTS

.PP The -mounts <directories> command-line option supplies a comma-separated list of directories to be \'bind mounted\' under the user\'s home directory. This causes these directories to be seen as subdirectories under the user\'s home directory. This is particularly useful when used with \'chhome\' as it allows a /lib /etc /bin directory to be supplied within the user\'s chrooted chroot directory, limiting what they have access to. By default the directories are mounted as copies of themselves, so \'-mounts /lib,/bin,/etc would mount the directories as /lib, /bin and /etc UNDER THE USERS HOME DIRECTORY. However, the use of the syntax \'<source dir>:<mount point> allows directories to be mounted in different places under the users home directory. e.g. \'/usr/jail/lib:/lib,/usr/jail/bin:/bin\' would mount /usr/jail/lib and /usr/jail/bin as /lib and /bin respectively.

.SH LOGIN/LOGOUT SCRIPTS
.PP
The \'-login-script\' and \'-logout-script\' options allow scripts to be run on login/logout respectively. These scripts are run *outside* of the \'chhome\' style of chroot, allowing the login script to copy things into the user\'s chroot-jail, then the user is chrooted into it, and when their session ends the logout script can import/copy files from the jail to the larger system.

.SH HONEYPOT MODE
.PP
The \'-honeypot\' argument invokes a special mode in which Paranoid TelnetD will pretend to authenticate users, but will never accept any credentials as valid. It also logs everything as \'critical\'. This provides a kind of poor-person\'s honeypot, as Paranoid TelnetD can be installed on systems that no-one should ever telnet into, and the logs watched for \'critical\' error messages coming out of ptelnetd.

.SH INETD
.PP
If run out of inetd then obviously interface and port cannot be specified, nor will a pid file be created.

.SH IPv6
.PP
IPv6 support is disabled in the default build, but can be built in with \'configure --enable-ip6\'. If you compile ptelnetd with IPv6, and then run ptelnetd without a specified interface, then both IPv4 and IPv6 will work. If you specify an interface then, if you specify it by interface name, or by an IPv4 address, only IPv4 will work, whereas if you specify and IPv6 address, only IPv6 will work.  Thus if you want to run both IPv4 and IPv6 on a specific interface, you\'ll have to launch two ptelnetd processes, one bound to the IPv4 address and one to the IPv6.
